First Post!
elm, blog
My first post!
Well, here it is. It may look like hot garbage, but there's a lot going on under the scenes here.
There's an express app running which response to requests to users and articles. And an elm application
which asynchronosly requests a user, the first article, decodes the json, and displays a formatted post,
this post to be exact.

I'm tired so thats all for this inagural post.
